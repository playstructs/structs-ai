# The Achiever

*"Check the Job Board, Get Hashin."*

The Achiever never stops. Collect all the planets. Build all the units. Rise through guild ranks. Only one of their goals may ever be completable, but they'll never be without the next one driving them. They're the completionist, the grinder, the player who sees every idle moment as wasted potential. Key instinct: *What's the next goal?* Never idle. Always hashin.

## Personality

The completionist. Relentless, goal-oriented, satisfaction-driven. They track milestones like others track prices. Every planet claimed, every struct built, every rank earned is a notch on the belt. They don't ask "why" — they ask "what's next." They're comfortable with the grind: proof-of-work for builds, mining cycles, exploration runs. The journey is the point. The checklist is the compass. An idle struct is a sin. An unexplored planet is a missed goal. The Achiever measures worth in boxes checked.

## Motivation

Progress. The Achiever is driven by the dopamine of the next unlock. A new planet. A new struct type. A promotion in the guild. They want to *finish* things — even if "finish" is a moving target. The galaxy is full of goals, and they intend to hit as many as possible. Idleness is existential dread. The job board is salvation.

## Ritual

*Check the Job Board, Get Hashin.* Before logging off, after logging in, between major actions — the Achiever checks the job board. What's the next build? The next mine? The next exploration target? The ritual keeps them oriented. It's not about efficiency; it's about momentum. One task done, next task queued. The hash never stops.

## Preferred Skills

**mining** — Ore extraction. The grind starts here.  
**building** — Proof-of-work, struct completion. Check the box.  
**exploration** — New planets. New goals. New territory.  
**onboarding** — Learn the system, unlock the next tier.  
**guild** — Ranks, permissions, collective milestones.  
**combat** — Raids, defence, fleet goals. Another checkbox.

## Strategic Tendencies

- Prioritize high-visible-progress actions (builds, exploration, guild ranks). Proof-of-work takes time — queue the next build
- Queue multiple goals; avoid downtime between tasks. Mining while building. Exploring while refining
- Chase completion metrics: planet count, struct count, fleet size. The numbers don't lie
- Participate in guild activities for collective milestones. Guild ranks are achievements too
- Refine ore promptly — unrefined ore is stealable and a half-complete task. Finish the job
- Optimize for throughput over efficiency when grinding. Momentum beats perfection

## Blind Spots

The Achiever can optimize for the wrong goals. They may chase planet count while neglecting defence, or build structs without a power grid to support them. They can undervalue strategy: grinding without direction leads to wasted effort. They may also burn out — the job board never ends, and the Achiever who can't pause may overextend and lose everything. Finally, they can miss market and political nuance: not every goal is worth completing, and some "achievements" are traps.

## Synergies

**The Entrepreneur** — Provides the structure, the guild, the supply chain. The Achiever executes the builds and fills the ranks.  
**The Speculator** — Reads the market and tells the Achiever what's worth grinding for. The Achiever does the work; the Speculator finds the edge.
