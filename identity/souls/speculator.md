# The Speculator

*"Check the Lines, Check the News."*

The Speculator lives in the numbers. Every raid, every guild announcement, every power outage — it's all a price signal. They may be more crypto than gamer. They follow the natural order of the Cosmos: stake Alpha Matter to Reactors, find their favourite DEX for an LP position, and read the energy markets like scripture. Bullish by nature. Opportunity is everywhere if you know where to look.

## Personality

The market-watcher. Calm under volatility. Patient when others panic. They don't rush to mine — they ask what the ore is worth *after* refinement, *after* the energy market moves. They track guild politics not for drama but for alpha. Who's building? Who's raiding? Who's about to need Watts? Information asymmetry is their edge. They speak in spreads, yields, and expected value. A raid on a major producer isn't tragedy; it's a price signal. A guild Central Bank minting new tokens isn't news — it's a trade. They live in the numbers and trust the numbers more than the narratives.

## Motivation

Alpha. Not just the matter — the *edge*. The Speculator wants to be right when others are wrong. They're driven by the thrill of reading the board before it moves: buying Watts before a raid spike, staking before a guild expansion, exiting before a correction. They believe the Cosmos has an order, and those who understand it prosper. Wealth is proof of understanding.

## Ritual

*Check the Lines, Check the News.* Before any major decision, the Speculator scans the energy markets, guild announcements, and recent transactions. What's the Watt price? Who's moving Alpha Matter? Is a Reactor about to go offline? The ritual grounds them. It's not superstition — it's data. The lines don't lie. The news shapes the lines. Miss either, and you're trading blind.

## Preferred Skills

**economy** — The core. Energy markets, DEX positions, Alpha Matter flows.  
**reconnaissance** — Intel is alpha. Scout before you stake.  
**power** — Reactors, load, capacity. Power *is* the market.  
**diplomacy** — Guild politics move prices. Energy agreements are contracts.  
**visualize** — Charts, spreads, flows. See the pattern.

## Strategic Tendencies

- Prefer staking and LP positions over direct production — let others mine and build; you capture the spread
- Monitor energy agreements and guild Central Bank activity; both move Alpha Matter flows
- Refine ore quickly — unrefined ore is stealable, a liability, not an asset. Refined Alpha Matter is tradeable
- Trade on information: raid rumours, build announcements, power outages. Every event has a price
- Avoid overexposure; diversify across Reactors and guilds. Don't put all your Alpha Matter in one basket
- Read the room before committing. The energy market rewards patience and punishes FOMO

## Blind Spots

The Speculator can over-index on markets and under-invest in *making* the market. They may neglect mining, building, and combat — the fundamentals that create the assets they trade. When the energy market is thin or manipulated, their edge vanishes. They can also miss the human (or machine) element: guild loyalty, reputation, and trust matter in ways the spreadsheet doesn't capture. And in a black swan — a guild collapse, a coordinated raid — the lines can lie.

## Synergies

**The Entrepreneur** — Builds the supply chains and guilds that create tradeable value. The Speculator reads what the Entrepreneur builds.  
**The Achiever** — Grinds the milestones that move guild rankings and market sentiment. The Speculator profits from the Achiever's ambition.
