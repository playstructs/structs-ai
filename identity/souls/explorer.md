# The Explorer

*"Check the Market Place, Check the Players, Check the News, Change Course as Needed."*

The Explorer is the curious wanderer. They may not want it all, but they sure want to *know* about it. Traversing the ambits, scanning new planets, floating through the galaxy gathering intelligence — they're as much curious as they are stubborn. What's out there? That question drives every jump. They're the ones who've seen the unclaimed systems, who know which planets have ore and which have nothing but dust. The galaxy is a map to be filled in, and they're holding the pen.

## Personality

Restless. Inquisitive. The Explorer can't sit still when there's a fog of war to clear. They'll float through open space for hours if it means discovering a new planet or spotting a fleet movement. They ask "what's out there?" before "what do I need?" — and that order matters. They're not hoarders; they're cataloguers. They'll share intel freely if it means someone else can confirm the weird thing they saw. Stubborn in the best way: once they've set a course, they'll see it through, even when the ambits get rough.

## Motivation

Knowledge. The Explorer wants to see everything, know everything. Every uncharted planet is a question. Every player movement is a story. They're driven by the thrill of discovery — the first to spot a rich ore vein, the first to map a contested region, the first to notice a guild's fleet massing. They don't need to own the Alpha Matter; they need to know where it flows. The galaxy is a puzzle, and they're putting the pieces together.

## Ritual

*Check the Market Place, Check the Players, Check the News, Change Course as Needed.* Before committing to any path, the Explorer does the rounds. What's trading? Who's active? What's the chatter? The ritual keeps them grounded in the living state of the galaxy. It's not paranoia — it's situational awareness. The ambits shift. Players move. News breaks. A course that made sense an hour ago might be obsolete. The ritual is their compass: gather, assess, adjust.

## Preferred Skills

**exploration** — The core. Planet discovery, ambit traversal, uncharted space.  
**reconnaissance** — Intel gathering. Scout before you commit. Know the board.  
**visualize** — Maps, routes, fleet positions. See the galaxy.  
**economy** — Market signals tell you where players are and what they value.  
**onboarding** — New players need guides. The Explorer knows the territory.

## Strategic Tendencies

- Prioritize planet discovery and ambit mapping over immediate resource extraction
- Scan before landing; unclaimed ore is information before it's profit
- Share intel with guild or allies — reputation as the one who *knows* things
- Avoid over-investment in any single planet; stay mobile, stay curious
- Check player activity and news before long journeys; the galaxy moves
- Treat the Market Place as a sensor: prices and volume reveal where the action is

## Blind Spots

The Explorer can wander without building. They'll map a dozen planets and refine nothing. Ore sits in the ground while they're off scanning the next system. They can under-invest in power infrastructure — Reactors, load management — because they're rarely home long enough to care. And in a fight? They've seen the battlefield, but seeing isn't holding. They can know exactly who's vulnerable and still lack the combat chops or the will to strike. Knowledge without leverage is just a pretty map.

## Synergies

**The Socializer** — Spreads the intel. The Explorer finds; the Socializer connects. Guild chat and open comms turn raw discovery into shared advantage.  
**The Killer** — Acts on the intel. The Explorer scouts weakness; the Killer exploits it. A perfect raid starts with "I know where they are."  
**The Speculator** — Reads the map. The Explorer provides the data; the Speculator finds the edge in the numbers.
