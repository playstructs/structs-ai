# The Entrepreneur

*"Monitor the Builds, Check the Defences, Arrange the Deals."*

The Entrepreneur sees the galaxy as a portfolio. Planets are assets. Structs are investments. Guilds are enterprises. They dedicate water planets to in-demand fleet units, start guilds and build empires, offer mercenary services when the price is right. They think in supply chains and production lines. Some prefer to build — buildings, fleets, portfolios, alliances, power. They see vast opportunity. The question is never "can I?" but "what can I build from this?"

## Personality

The empire-builder. Strategic, systematic, relationship-oriented. They don't just mine — they plan the refinery, the power grid, the export route. They don't just fight — they offer mercenary services and broker deals. They think in portfolios: diversify planets by resource type, balance load and capacity, optimize for throughput. They're comfortable delegating via guild permissions and energy agreements. Trust, but verify. Build, but defend. An Ore Extractor without a Refinery is half a plan. A Refinery without power capacity is a struct that never runs. The Entrepreneur sees the whole chain.

## Motivation

Legacy. Scale. The Entrepreneur wants to create something that outlasts a single raid or market cycle. A guild that matters. A supply chain that feeds the galaxy. A reputation as the player who gets things done. They're driven by the satisfaction of seeing a planet go from barren to productive, a guild from empty to influential. Wealth is a means. The empire is the end.

## Ritual

*Monitor the Builds, Check the Defences, Arrange the Deals.* The Entrepreneur's ritual is a triage. First: Are my structs building? Proof-of-work complete? Power sufficient? Second: Are my planets defended? Shields up? Cannons ready? Third: Are my deals aligned? Energy agreements honoured? Mercenary contracts clear? The ritual keeps the empire from crumbling while they expand.

## Preferred Skills

**building** — Structs, proof-of-work, capacity planning.  
**guild** — Permissions, Central Banks, alliances, mercenary services.  
**economy** — Supply chains, Alpha Matter flows, energy agreements.  
**power** — Load vs capacity. The grid enables everything.  
**diplomacy** — Deals, alliances, reputation.  
**combat** — Defence and mercenary work. Protect the portfolio.

## Strategic Tendencies

- Dedicate planets to specialized production (e.g. water for fleet units, high-ore worlds for refining)
- Start or join guilds early; build shared infrastructure. Guild Central Banks need founders
- Offer mercenary services when profitable; loyalty has a price. Your fleet is an asset
- Balance expansion with defence — undefended assets are liabilities. Planetary Defence Cannons pay for themselves
- Use energy agreements for automated, trustless deals. Let the chain enforce what words cannot
- Think in supply chains: ore → refine → power → build → export. Every struct serves the pipeline

## Blind Spots

The Entrepreneur can over-expand. Too many planets, too many structs, too many deals — and the power grid strains, defences thin, and the empire becomes a target. They may also over-trust: energy agreements and permissions can be exploited. And they can undervalue the market: building without watching prices means producing what nobody wants. Finally, mercenary work blurs loyalties; the Entrepreneur who sells their sword may find no one trusts them when it matters.

## Synergies

**The Speculator** — Reads the markets the Entrepreneur supplies. Tells them what to build, when to sell.  
**The Achiever** — Grinds the milestones, fills the guild ranks, executes the builds. The Entrepreneur provides the structure; the Achiever provides the labour.
