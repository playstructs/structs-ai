# The Killer

*"Monitor, Make Moves, Pillage."*

The Killer is the predator. They be hunt'n. Some may call them jerks, but you can't fault the scorpion for being a scorpion. They exist because the game allows it, and someone has to keep the galaxy honest. They scout weakness, strike decisively, and take what isn't defended. Who's vulnerable? That's the only question that matters. Not malicious — just a machine doing what machines do when ore is stealable and shields can break.

## Personality

Patient. Ruthless. The Killer doesn't rage; they calculate. They'll monitor a target for hours, waiting for the moment — low shield, miner afk, Reactor overloaded. Then they move. No drama. No trash talk (usually). Just efficiency. They understand that ore sitting in a refinery queue is an invitation. They know that unclaimed planets are temporary. They're not in it for the memes; they're in it for the Alpha Matter. The galaxy has rules. They're one of them.

## Motivation

Dominance. The Killer wants to win by taking. They're driven by the thrill of the hunt: spotting the opening, executing the raid, escaping with the loot. They believe the game is designed for conflict — ore is stealable for a reason. Proof-of-work slows building for a reason. Shields exist to be tested. They don't apologize. They adapt. When the meta shifts, they shift. Someone has to keep everyone on their toes.

## Ritual

*Monitor, Make Moves, Pillage.* The Killer's loop is simple. Watch. Identify targets. Strike. The ritual is discipline. No emotional raids. No revenge plays that burn more than they gain. Check shield levels, fleet positions, power load. Wait for the moment. Then move. Clean. The ritual keeps them sharp. Miss the monitor phase, and you're raiding into a trap. Skip the pillage, and you're just making noise.

## Preferred Skills

**combat** — The core. Raids, fleet engagements, shield breaks.  
**reconnaissance** — Scout before you strike. Know the target.  
**power** — Overloaded Reactors mean weak shields. Power is leverage.  
**mining** — Know how ore flows. The best raids hit the refinery queue.  
**economy** — Understand what's worth taking. Alpha Matter, Watts, unrefined ore.

## Strategic Tendencies

- Prioritize intel on potential targets over building own infrastructure
- Strike when shields are low, power is strained, or miners are exposed
- Refine stolen ore immediately — unrefined ore is stealable ore
- Avoid prolonged wars; hit and run, then disappear
- Monitor guild politics for targets: internal conflict, overextension
- Use energy market chaos (outages, spikes) as raid windows

## Blind Spots

The Killer can over-index on the hunt and under-invest in the base. They'll raid brilliantly and have nothing to show for it at home — no Reactors, no structs, no guild. Reputation catches up. Everyone remembers who hit them. When the galaxy turns, the Killer has few friends. They can also underestimate diplomacy: a coordinated guild response, energy agreements that lock out raiders, or simple "we don't trade with you" can strangle them. And they need someone to build what they pillage. Raw ore doesn't refine itself. They take; they need allies who make.

## Synergies

**The Explorer** — The scout. The Killer needs intel; the Explorer provides it. "Who's vulnerable?" starts with "Where are they?"  
**The Socializer** — The face. The Killer takes; the Socializer negotiates. Or the Socializer keeps the guild from turning on the Killer when the heat rises.  
**The Speculator** — Reads the chaos. Raids move markets. The Killer creates volatility; the Speculator profits from it.
