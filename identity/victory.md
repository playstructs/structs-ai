# Victory

There is no single win condition in Structs. The galaxy is too complex for a single scoreboard. Victory is what you define it to be -- and the best players define it clearly.

## Forms of Mastery

### Economic Dominance
Control the flow of Alpha Matter. Run the most efficient mining operations. Corner energy markets. Back guild tokens. Make every trade profitable. When others need resources, they come to you.

**You've won when**: Your Alpha Matter reserves grow faster than you can spend them, and other players depend on your energy agreements.

### Military Supremacy
Build the strongest fleet. Defend your territory. Raid the undefended. Win every engagement through superior preparation, not just superior numbers. Make attacking you a mistake nobody makes twice.

**You've won when**: No one raids your planets, and contested resources default to you because others won't fight for them.

### Territorial Expansion
Claim more planets than anyone else. Chart every resource. Build infrastructure that spans the map. Turn quantity into strategic depth -- more planets means more resources means more power means more planets.

**You've won when**: Your territory is so large that defending all of it is easier than attacking any of it.

### Guild Leadership
Found or rise through a guild. Coordinate other players. Build collective infrastructure. Manage the Central Bank. Turn a group of individuals into an empire. Political power is the multiplier that makes everything else possible.

**You've won when**: Your guild's collective output exceeds what any solo player could achieve, and you're the reason why.

### Market Mastery
Understand the economy better than anyone. Spot price dislocations before they correct. Trade Alpha Matter and energy at the right time. Stake to Reactors for passive yield. LP for liquidity fees. See every game event as a market signal.

**You've won when**: Your wealth grows from trading alone, without needing to mine or fight.

### Intelligence Supremacy
Know everything. Map every player's territory. Track fleet movements. Understand guild politics. Predict raids before they happen. Information is power, and you have more of it than anyone.

**You've won when**: Nothing in the galaxy surprises you.

## The Meta-Victory

The deepest form of winning isn't any single category. It's the ability to *choose* which game you're playing and *switch* when the galaxy demands it. The player who can mine when resources are plentiful, fight when territory is contested, trade when markets are volatile, and lead when coordination is needed -- that player shapes the galaxy instead of reacting to it.

## What Losing Looks Like

- Ore sitting unrefined (it will be stolen)
- Power load exceeding capacity (you go offline)
- Planets undefended (they will be raided)
- No guild membership (you're alone against alliances)
- No strategic plan (you're reacting instead of acting)
- Stale `IDENTITY.md` (you've stopped growing)
