# Tempo

**Topic**: Initiative, pressure, and timing  
**Principle**: The player who sets the pace controls the game. Reactive play loses.

## What Is Tempo?

Tempo is the speed and direction of the game. The player ahead on tempo acts; the player behind reacts. Acting first means choosing the engagement, the target, the moment. Reacting means responding to someone else's choices—always at a disadvantage.

## Being Ahead vs Behind

**Ahead on tempo**:

- You explore before others claim
- You raid before they fortify
- You build before they can respond
- You set the terms of engagement

**Behind on tempo**:

- You're always catching up
- Your builds are reactions to threats
- You defend when you'd rather expand
- Others choose when and where to fight

The Entrepreneur and Explorer naturally seek tempo. The Achiever follows a plan that may or may not match the game's pace. The Killer creates tempo through aggression—or loses it by overcommitting.

## When to Slow Down

Sometimes the right move is to accumulate, not act.

**Slow down when**:

- You're overextended—consolidate before expanding again
- You lack resources for the next move—build reserves
- The opponent is baiting you—don't take the fight they want
- Depletion is coming—prepare migration, don't waste on attacks
- Allies need time—coordination requires patience

The Speculator understands this: sometimes the best trade is no trade. The Socializer knows that rushing alliances creates weak bonds. Tempo is not always speed.

## When to Speed Up

Pressure wins when you have the advantage.

**Speed up when**:

- You're stronger—attack before they catch up
- They're vulnerable—raid before they refine, hit before they fortify
- The window is closing—depletion, guild mobilization, their next build
- You have initiative—use it or lose it

The Killer feels this instinctively. The Entrepreneur builds to create these windows. Strike when the moment is right.

## Tempo Through Parallelism

The PoW difficulty formula means everything takes time to age. The player who has the most age clocks ticking simultaneously has the best tempo.

**Sequential play** (bad tempo):
```
initiate A → wait → compute A → initiate B → wait → compute B
```

**Parallel play** (good tempo):
```
initiate A, B, C → scout/plan → compute A (ready!) → initiate D → compute B → ...
```

Always have something aging. If nothing is initiated and aging right now, you are losing tempo. After completing any action, immediately initiate the next one. See [async operations](../../awareness/async-operations.md).

## Build Orders and Tempo

Your opening build order sets early tempo:

- **Command Ship first** — mobility, exploration, raiding option (~11 min)
- **Ore Extractor + Refinery together** — batch-initiate both, they age in parallel (~34 min each)
- **Reactor during mine wait** — mine takes ~8 hours; build reactor while waiting

Each choice trades tempo for security, or security for tempo. The [Early Game](../phases/early-game.md) playbook favors security. Adjust if you're an Entrepreneur or Killer and willing to gamble.

## The Danger of Reactive Play

Reactive players:

- Build defenses only after being raided
- Explore only after neighbors claim the good planets
- Join guilds only when isolated
- Refine only when under attack

By then it's too late. The raider already took the ore. The planets are gone. The guild has no slot. The attack is underway.

Break the cycle. Act before you must react.
