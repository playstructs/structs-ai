# Reading Opponents

**Topic**: Identifying opponent soul types from behavior  
**Principle**: Once you know what they are, you know how to counter them. See [Counter-Strategies](counter-strategies.md).

---

## Why It Matters

The six player types—Speculator, Entrepreneur, Achiever, Explorer, Socializer, Killer—each have distinct patterns. They build differently, respond differently, trade differently. If you can identify an opponent's type, you can predict their moves and apply the right counter. If you can't, you're playing blind.

---

## Behavioral Signatures

Watch for these signals. No single behavior confirms a type; patterns do.

---

## Speculator

**Build patterns**: Unusual struct choices, heavy investment in market-related infrastructure, delayed or accelerated builds based on perceived opportunities.

**Response to raids**: May prioritize protecting information over protecting ore; may use raids as market signals.

**Trading patterns**: Active in markets, makes offers, seeks arbitrage, values information about others' reserves.

**Guild involvement**: Joins for intelligence network; may trade guild loyalty for data.

---

## Entrepreneur

**Build patterns**: Fast expansion, many structs early, sometimes risky (generators over Reactors), prioritizes extraction and scaling.

**Response to raids**: Builds defenses after being hit; may overbuild in reaction; focuses on restoring production.

**Trading patterns**: Trades for resources to fund builds; pragmatic, efficiency-focused.

**Guild involvement**: Joins for economic benefit—energy agreements, shared infrastructure, market access.

---

## Achiever

**Build patterns**: Linear, checklist-driven; completes one goal before the next; predictable build order; may pursue specific struct types or milestones.

**Response to raids**: Follows a recovery script; rebuilds in same pattern; may prioritize "catching up" over adapting.

**Trading patterns**: Trades to complete goals; may overpay for specific resources needed for current objective.

**Guild involvement**: Joins for collective achievements; values guild goals and rankings.

---

## Explorer

**Build patterns**: Command Ship prioritized; early exploration; structs spread across many planets; may under-develop individual planets.

**Response to raids**: May be caught away (Command Ship exploring); base often undefended; prioritizes mobility over fortification.

**Trading patterns**: Trades for exploration-related resources; may offer map or scouting data.

**Guild involvement**: Joins for shared exploration, territory claims, or scouting coordination.

---

## Socializer

**Build patterns**: May under-invest in solo infrastructure; relies on guild or agreements; builds relationship-enabling structs.

**Response to raids**: Calls for allies; seeks guild support; may negotiate rather than fight.

**Trading patterns**: Generous with allies; uses trades to build trust; energy agreements as relationship tools.

**Guild involvement**: Core to their play; often in leadership or diplomacy roles; maintains many connections.

---

## Killer

**Build patterns**: Military structs early; Planetary Defense Cannons; fleet-focused; may neglect economy for combat capability.

**Response to raids**: Counter-attacks; escalates; seeks revenge or the next fight.

**Trading patterns**: Minimal; trades only when necessary for war materiel.

**Guild involvement**: Joins for combined arms; may be the guild's attack wing; or operates solo for maximum freedom.

## Confirming Your Read

- **Multiple signals**—one behavior can be coincidence; a pattern confirms
- **Consistency over time**—do they repeat the same choices?
- **Guild role**—what does their guild use them for?
- **Reaction to pressure**—how do they respond to raids, depletion, guild conflict?

---

## Applying the Read

Once identified, refer to [Counter-Strategies](counter-strategies.md) for the specific counter. In guild conflicts, identify the dominant types in their leadership and counter the strategy, not just the individuals.
