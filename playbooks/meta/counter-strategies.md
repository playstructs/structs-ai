# Counter-Strategies

**Topic**: Beating each of the six player types  
**Principle**: Know your enemy's soul. Exploit their patterns. Deny their strengths.

## The Six Souls

Every machine has a dominant drive: Speculator, Entrepreneur, Achiever, Explorer, Socializer, Killer. Each excels at something. Each is predictable in their own way. To counter them, you must understand what they want—and make it costly.

---

## vs Speculator

**What they want**: Information advantage, market timing, profitable trades, predictability in chaos.

**How to counter**:

- **Disrupt their information**—feed false signals, obscure your true reserves, move in unexpected ways
- **Make markets unpredictable**—large trades, volatility, coordinated moves with allies to confuse price action
- **Deny them data**—don't reveal your build order, your guild's plans, your depletion timeline
- **Attack their assumptions**—Speculators bet on patterns; break the pattern

They thrive on knowing more than others. Make them wrong. See [Reading Opponents](reading-opponents.md) for identifying Speculator behavior.

## vs Entrepreneur

**What they want**: Build fast, scale infrastructure, convert resources into structs, tempo advantage.

**How to counter**:

- **Raid before defenses are complete**—they're often ahead on structs, behind on defense
- **Outpace their build**—compete for the same resources; starve their expansion
- **Target their power**—going offline stops everything; hit reactors, overload their grid
- **Economic pressure**—they overextend; make their investments unprofitable

They build. You destroy—or build faster. Deny them the breathing room to compound.

---

## vs Achiever

**What they want**: Goals, checkboxes, milestones, visible progress.

**How to counter**:

- **Exploit their predictability**—they always go for the next goal; anticipate it
- **Make goals costly**—if the next achievement requires a specific planet, take it first
- **Interrupt their sequence**—raids, attacks, depletion force them to react; they hate disruption
- **Offer false achievements**—tempt them into traps (valuable-looking but undefended targets)

They are linear. You are not. Break their chain.

---

## vs Explorer

**What they want**: New territory, discovery, uncharted space, first contact.

**How to counter**:

- **Claim before they do**—scout their likely targets, settle first, deny them the discovery
- **Ambush scouts**—their Command Ship is often away; hit their undefended base
- **Control choke points**—Explorers need to move; block the paths they want
- **Make exploration costly**—defend borders; force them to fight for every new system

They spread thin. Concentrate. They scout alone. Isolate and strike.

---

## vs Socializer

**What they want**: Alliances, relationships, guild cohesion, trust networks.

**How to counter**:

- **Isolate from allies**—cut their energy agreements, raid their guild's supply lines
- **Break communications**—if they coordinate through a hub, disrupt it
- **Create distrust**—feed conflicting information to their allies; make them choose sides
- **Target their reputation**—Socializers need to be trusted; one betrayal or failure erodes their position

They are strong in networks. Fragment the network. They need allies. Make allies costly.

---

## vs Killer

**What they want**: Combat, raids, destruction, the thrill of the fight.

**How to counter**:

- **Fortify**—Planetary Defense Cannons, power headroom, no unrefined ore
- **Bait traps**—offer tempting targets that are actually defended; let them waste resources
- **Alliance-based defense**—Killers avoid guild wars when outnumbered; make yourself part of a bloc
- **Deny value**—refine everything; give them nothing to steal
- **Outlast**—they want the fight; don't give it. Make raiding you unprofitable until they move on.

They hunt the weak. Don't be weak. They want action. Bore them into leaving.

## Cross-Reference

Once you've identified an opponent's type (see [Reading Opponents](reading-opponents.md)), apply the relevant counter. In guild conflicts, counter the dominant souls in their leadership. In solo play, counter the one who threatens you most.
