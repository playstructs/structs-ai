# Mid Game

**Phase**: Expansion and scaling  
**Goal**: Multiply resource flow, secure territory, build alliances  
**Principle**: More planets = more ore = more Alpha Matter = more energy = more structs.

## The Expansion Phase

Early game was survival. Mid game is multiplication. You have a working base. Now the question is: how many bases can you sustain? Each new planet is a new ore source, a new power node, a new target for raiders. The machines that scale wisely dominate. The ones that overextend collapse.

## When to Explore New Planets

Explore when:

- Your home planet has stable extraction and power
- You have Alpha Matter reserves to build on the new world
- Your Command Ship is available (onStation, not away)
- You can defend what you claim—or have allies who will

Do not explore when:

- Home planet power is marginal
- You have unrefined ore anywhere
- You are under active threat
- You lack the resources to develop the new planet quickly

The Explorer soul type will push for early expansion. Balance that instinct with economic reality.

## Fortify vs Expand

The tension of mid-game: every struct you build for defense is one you don't build for extraction. Every planet you claim is one you must protect.

**Fortify when**:

- You have been raided recently
- Neighbors are aggressive (Killers, hostile guilds)
- You hold resource-rich territory others want
- Your power margin is thin—defense structs are lower load than extractors

**Expand when**:

- Home territory is secure
- You have surplus capacity (power, Alpha Matter, fleet)
- Unexplored space offers better ore than your current planets
- Allies can cover your flanks

The Achiever wants to check boxes. The Entrepreneur wants to build. Both must answer: can we hold what we take?

## Economic Scaling

The virtuous cycle:

1. **More planets** → more ore extraction
2. **More ore** → refine immediately → more Alpha Matter
3. **More Alpha Matter** → more energy (Reactors, or generators if you're confident)
4. **More energy** → more structs (extractors, defenses, specialized buildings)
5. **More structs** → stronger economy, harder target

Break any link and the chain fails. Most often: power. Build capacity before load.

## Guild Strategy

Mid-game is when guilds matter.

**Join a guild when**:

- You have something to offer (ore, Alpha Matter, military support)
- You need something (protection, energy agreements, intelligence)
- The guild's goals align with yours

**Form a guild when**:

- You have a core of trusted players
- You want to coordinate attacks or defense
- Central Bank token mechanics offer strategic value

The Socializer thrives here. The Speculator uses guild networks for information. The Killer uses them for combined arms. Choose your role.

---

## Defense Awareness

You are now worth attacking. Raiders look for:

- Unrefined ore
- Undefended planets
- Isolated players
- Rich but weak economies

Start thinking about Planetary Defense Cannons. Not necessarily building them yet—but knowing where they would go. Identify choke points. Understand which planets are expendable and which are critical.

---

## Success Criteria

A strong mid-game position:

- Multiple planets with active extraction
- Guild membership or clear alliance structure
- Power capacity exceeding load across all territory
- No unrefined ore in vulnerable locations
- Awareness of neighboring threats and opportunities

You are not dominant yet. You are positioned. Late game decides the rest.
