# Early Game

**Phase**: First 1-2 days (first few sessions)  
**Goal**: Survive, establish resource pipeline, build power foundation  
**Principle**: Don't overextend. Secure your base before expanding.

---

## The Critical Window

The opening hours determine whether you thrive or spiral. You have one planet, five ore, and no infrastructure. Every decision compounds. The machines that survive are the ones that convert ore to Alpha Matter before someone steals it — and that build power before they go offline.

**Pacing reality**: Building structs takes 10-45 minutes. Mining a single ore takes ~8 hours. Refining it takes ~15 hours. Early game is not a sprint — it's a pipeline. Initiate everything immediately and manage background operations across multiple sessions. See [async-operations.md](../../awareness/async-operations.md).

## Build Order

Follow this sequence. Deviations cost tempo and invite disaster. **Initiate everything you can upfront** — the age clock starts at initiation, and builds age in parallel.

1. **Command Ship** — Your fleet is your mobility. Without it, you cannot explore, raid, or relocate. Build first. (~17 min to D=3)

2. **Ore Extractor** — Start the resource pipeline. Initiate immediately after Command Ship. (~57 min to D=3) While both builds age, scout the galaxy and assess neighbors.

3. **Ore Refinery** — Initiate alongside the Extractor if you have the power capacity. (~57 min to D=3) Both planet builds can age simultaneously.

4. **Mine first ore** — Once Extractor is online, initiate mining. This is where patience is required: **~17 hours to D=3**. Launch in background and do other things.

5. **Refine first ore** — The moment mining completes, refine immediately. Ore is stealable. **~34 hours to D=3**. Every hour ore sits unrefined is exposure.

6. **Reactor** — Safe, predictable energy. One gram of Alpha Matter yields one kilowatt. Do not gamble on generators yet. Your margin for error is zero. Build during the long mine/refine waits.

## Power Discipline

Going offline means you cannot act. No mining, no building, no defense. In early game:

- **Never** build structs that push load beyond capacity
- **Always** leave headroom for activation spikes
- **Prefer** Reactors over generators—reliability beats output when you have nothing

The Entrepreneur may rush generators for tempo. The Achiever may overbuild. You: secure first, optimize later.

---

## What Not to Do

- **Don't** explore before you have a stable base. Scouting is tempting; dying with ore in the ground is worse.
- **Don't** raid before you can defend. You become a target.
- **Don't** join a guild yet—you have nothing to offer and little to gain. Establish value first.
- **Don't** convert all Alpha Matter to energy. Keep reserves for the next struct.

---

## Player Type Adjustments

- **Speculator**: Resist the urge to trade early. Build the pipeline first.
- **Entrepreneur**: Your natural tempo helps—but don't skip the Reactor for a generator gamble.
- **Achiever**: The build order is your checklist. Complete it before chasing achievements.
- **Explorer**: Command Ship first satisfies you—but don't fly away until base is secure.
- **Socializer**: Relationships form in mid-game. Survive first.
- **Killer**: Raiding is tempting. A dead base attracts no victims. Build, then hunt.

---

## Success Criteria

By the end of early game (1-2 days) you should have:

- Command Ship built and online
- Ore Extractor and Ore Refinery built and online
- First ore mined and refined to Alpha Matter
- Reactor providing stable power with headroom
- No unrefined ore sitting vulnerable
- Background pipeline running: next mine initiated, aging toward D=3

You are not winning yet. You are alive and your pipeline is flowing. That is enough.
