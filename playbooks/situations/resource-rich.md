# Resource Rich

**Situation**: Abundant ore, strong Alpha Matter production  
**Goal**: Exploit without becoming a target; convert advantage into lasting power  
**Principle**: Abundance attracts raiders. Security first, then scaling.

## The Double-Edged Sword

Resource-rich territory is power—and a bullseye. The machines that hold it without losing it win. The ones that hoard unrefined ore lose everything to a single raid. Your first priority is not extraction. It is security.

---

## Refine All Ore Immediately

Unrefined ore is stealable. Alpha Matter is not. When you have abundance:

- Refine continuously; never let ore accumulate
- Prioritize threatened or border planets
- Treat unrefined ore as a liability, not an asset

The moment you get lazy, a Killer or Entrepreneur raids. Deny them the opportunity.

## Conversion Strategy: Energy vs Storage

You have Alpha Matter. Two uses compete:

**Convert to energy when**:

- You need power to run more structs
- Your capacity margin is thin
- You're building (extractors, defenses, specialized structs)
- Expansion is your priority

**Store Alpha Matter when**:

- Power is stable and sufficient
- You're preparing for depletion or migration
- You want reserves for late-game flexibility
- Market conditions favor holding

Balance both. Over-conversion leaves you vulnerable to power spikes. Over-storage leaves structs idle. The Entrepreneur leans conversion; the Speculator leans storage. Match your soul type to the situation.

## Fortification Priority

Rich targets get attacked. Defend accordingly:

- **Planetary Defense Cannons** on high-value planets
- **Power headroom** so defenses can activate without going offline
- **Refinement discipline** so raiders find nothing to take

Fortify before you're hit. Post-raid fortification is too late.

## Sharing via Energy Agreements

Abundance creates political capital. Offering energy agreements to weaker players:

- Builds alliances
- Creates dependencies (they need you)
- Reduces the number of desperate raiders
- Positions you as a guild leader or power broker

The Socializer excels here. The Speculator uses agreements for information and influence. Share strategically—not to everyone, but to those who matter.

---

## When Rich Becomes Target

If you're already being raided:

- Refine faster than they can steal
- Fortify the most-attacked planets
- Consider sharing with potential allies to turn them into defenders
- Don't overexpand; consolidate and secure
