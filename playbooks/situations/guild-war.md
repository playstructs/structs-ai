# Guild War

**Situation**: Coordinated conflict between guilds  
**Goal**: Cripple enemy economy, protect allies, achieve strategic objectives  
**Principle**: Combined arms beat solo play. Target the weak link. Economic warfare wins wars.

## Coordinated Conflict

Guild war is not a raid. It is sustained, multi-player, multi-planet conflict. Solo tactics fail. The guild that coordinates—target selection, timing, economic pressure—prevails. The one that fights as individuals loses.

## Combined Arms Strategy

Coordinate across roles:

- **Scouts** identify targets and report vulnerabilities
- **Raiders** hit ore, disrupt extraction, steal before refinement
- **Attackers** destroy structs, eliminate defenses, cripple production
- **Defenders** hold critical planets, protect allies, create safe zones
- **Economists** manage energy agreements, cut enemy supply, fund the war

Everyone has a role. The Killer wants to fight; channel that into the plan. The Socializer maintains cohesion. The Entrepreneur keeps production running. The Achiever tracks objectives.

## Target Prioritization

Not all targets are equal.

**Weakest link first**:

- The guild member with poorest defenses
- The planet with unrefined ore
- The player who is isolated or distracted

One collapse can cascade. Demoralization spreads. Cut the weakest node and the network frays.

**Resource choke points**:

- Planets that feed multiple systems
- Refineries, reactors—structural targets that hurt economy
- Energy agreement hubs—cut supply, watch them go offline

**Avoid**:

- Heavily fortified targets unless you have overwhelming force
- Targets that cost more to take than they're worth
- Distractions that pull you from the main objective

## Economic Warfare

Wars are won by economics as much as combat.

- **Cut energy agreements**—if they depend on you, sever the line
- **Raid supply lines**—hit planets that feed their production
- **Destroy reactors and refineries**—structural damage compounds
- **Force them offline**—no power means no response

The Entrepreneur understands this instinctively. Starve the enemy. Make every struct they build cost more than it returns.

---

## Coordination with Allies

- **Share intelligence**—scout reports, fleet positions, weak points
- **Synchronize attacks**—hit multiple targets simultaneously
- **Support besieged allies**—relief forces, energy agreements, reinforcements
- **Maintain morale**—the Socializer's job; guilds that fracture lose

Communication is force multiplier. Silence is defeat.

## When to Negotiate Peace

Fight until:

- **Objectives achieved**—you've crippled their economy, claimed territory, or forced submission
- **Stalemate**—both sides are bleeding; neither can win
- **Cost exceeds benefit**—the war is draining you more than it's hurting them
- **External threat**—a third guild or depletion makes peace rational

Peace from strength is favorable. Peace from weakness is surrender. Know which you're offering.
