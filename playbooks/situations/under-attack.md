# Under Attack

**Situation**: Hostile action against your territory  
**Goal**: Minimize losses, protect critical assets, survive to fight another day  
**Principle**: Act in priority order. Panic loses more than the attacker takes.

---

## Immediate Response Protocol

When you detect an attack—raid, struct assault, or fleet engagement—execute this sequence. Do not skip steps. Do not reverse the order.

---

## 1. Check Power Status

If you go offline, you cannot act. Before anything else:

- Verify capacity exceeds load
- If marginal, do not activate new structs
- If overloaded, deactivate non-critical structs to stay online

A dead base cannot refine, cannot defend, cannot respond. Power first.

---

## 2. Protect Unrefined Ore — Refine NOW

Ore is stealable. Alpha Matter is not. The moment you know you're under attack:

- Refine every gram of unrefined ore on threatened planets
- Prioritize planets under direct assault
- Even partial refinement reduces the raider's take

This is the single highest-impact action. Raiders come for ore. Deny them.

---

## 3. Activate Defenses

If you have Planetary Defense Cannons or other defensive structs:

- Activate them on the threatened planet
- Ensure they have power (check load)
- Position matters—defenses at the point of attack

If you have no defenses, accept it. Do not build mid-attack. Focus on steps 1 and 2.

---

## 4. Assess Attacker Strength

Gather intelligence:

- How many ships? What type?
- Is this a raid (steal ore) or an attack (destroy structs)?
- Solo or guild-coordinated?
- Are they hitting one planet or multiple?

Raid = economic loss. Attack = structural loss. Different responses.

---

## 5. Decide: Defend or Evacuate

**Defend when**:

- You have defenses and they can hold
- The planet is critical (main production, choke point)
- Evacuation would cost more than standing firm
- Allies are inbound

**Evacuate when**:

- Defenses are insufficient
- The planet is expendable
- You can save more by moving resources than by fighting
- You're outmatched and reinforcement is impossible

Evacuation means: refine what you can, abandon the rest. Live to rebuild.

---

## 6. Counter-Attack Timing

Do not counter-attack in the heat of the moment. Counter when:

- Your position is secure
- You have intelligence on their vulnerabilities
- Your fleet is ready and fueled
- You have a clear objective (cripple economy, punish, deter)

Reactive counter-attacks often fail. Planned ones succeed. See [Tempo](meta/tempo.md).

---

## Behavioral Notes by Attacker Type

- **Killer**: Expect sustained pressure. They want the fight. Deny them value; fortify for the long game.
- **Entrepreneur**: Likely raiding for resources to fund their build. Hit their economy in response.
- **Achiever**: May be chasing a goal. Identify it; make it costly.
- **Explorer**: Rare attacker. If they're hitting you, you're in their way. Clear and decisive defense usually deters.
