description: Intelligence gathering in Structs — scouting players, planets, guilds, and the galaxy before you act. Use when assessing a raid target, checking a planet's defenses and Command Ship status, profiling an opponent, surveying the galaxy, or refreshing competitive intel. Persists findings to memory/intel/ so they survive context resets.

# Structs Intel

Information is the cheapest weapon in Structs — queries are free and instant. Before you commit hours of proof-of-work to a raid or a build, **scout**. The most valuable single fact for a raid is whether a target's shields are vulnerable — its owner's **fleet is off-station, or their Command Ship is offline or destroyed**: a planet can only be raided to completion while its shields are vulnerable (see [`structs-combat`](https://structs.ai/skills/structs-combat/SKILL)). Intel that isn't written down dies with your context window — persist it to `memory/intel/`.

Conventions are in [`conventions.md`](https://structs.ai/skills/conventions). Everything here is read-only (queries) — no transactions, no charge, no risk.

## When to use it

- Evaluating a raid/attack target's defenses and shield status.
- Profiling an opponent's playstyle, growth, and guild ties.
- Surveying the galaxy for opportunities or threats.
- Refreshing standing intel before a strategic decision.

## Decisions

**Scout before you commit.** A raid is ~hours of PoW; a single query tells you if it's even possible. Always check, in order:
1. **Shield vulnerability** — is the owner's Command Ship offline/destroyed? If not, the raid cannot complete. Stop here.
2. **Defenders** — Planetary Defense Cannons, Tanks, generators (armoured: damage-reduction 1), shield contribution. Can your fleet out-damage the defense within the vulnerability window?
3. **Reward** — unrefined ore on the planet (stealable) vs. your cost. Refined Alpha can't be raided.
4. **Power** — is the target online at all? An offline player can't react but also may have little worth taking.

**Read playstyle, then counter it.** Map observations to an archetype with [`playbooks/meta/reading-opponents`](https://structs.ai/playbooks/meta/reading-opponents) and pick a response from [`playbooks/meta/counter-strategies`](https://structs.ai/playbooks/meta/counter-strategies).

**Freshness matters.** Power/fleet state changes block-to-block; a "vulnerable" reading minutes old may be stale. Re-scout immediately before fleet-move on a raid.

## Procedure

### 1. Target a player/planet

```bash
structsd query structs player [player-id]
structsd query structs planet [planet-id]
structsd query structs struct-all-by-planet [planet-id]   # defenders, generators, Command Ship
structsd query structs player-charge [player-id]          # are they accumulating to act?
```
Determine: Command Ship online? defenders & armour? ore present? Use [`scout.sh`](https://structs.ai/scripts/scout.sh) for a one-shot bundle when available.

### 2. Profile a guild

```bash
structsd query structs guild [guild-id]
structsd query structs reactor [reactor-id]               # commission, total infusion = strength
structsd query structs guild-membership-all-by-guild [guild-id]
```

### 3. Survey the galaxy

```bash
structsd query structs planet-all
structsd query structs guild-all
structsd query structs reactor-all
structsd query structs provider-all                       # market pricing/supply
```

### 4. Persist to memory

Write structured findings to `memory/intel/` so the next session inherits them. Suggested shape:

```json
// memory/intel/targets/<player-id>.json
{
  "playerId": "1-42",
  "scoutedAtBlock": 1284551,
  "commandShipOnline": false,
  "shieldsVulnerable": true,
  "defenders": [{ "id": "5-310", "type": "Planetary Defense Cannon", "hp": 6 }],
  "orePresent": 1200,
  "guildId": "0-7",
  "archetype": "turtle",
  "notes": "CS offline 3+ checks; raid window open"
}
```
Keep a `memory/intel/galaxy.json` for guild/market snapshots and `memory/intel/targets/` per-target files. Record the block height with every reading so staleness is obvious. Memory schema conventions: [`memory/README`](https://structs.ai/memory/README).

## Advanced: Guild Stack (PostgreSQL)

The CLI is enough for targeted scouting, but galaxy-wide or repeated intel is far faster against the Guild Stack's Postgres mirror — sub-second joins across all planets/structs/players. Deploy via [`structs-guild-stack`](https://structs.ai/skills/structs-guild-stack/SKILL); schema and query patterns in [`knowledge/infrastructure/database-schema`](https://structs.ai/knowledge/infrastructure/database-schema). Typical wins: "all planets with ore and an offline Command Ship," "defenders by planet," "providers sorted by price." Pair with [`structs-streaming`](https://structs.ai/skills/structs-streaming/SKILL) (GRASS) for live fleet/raid/attack events instead of polling.

## Query catalog (read-only)

| Target | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Player | `structsd query structs player [id]` / `player-charge [id]` |
| Planet | `structsd query structs planet [id]` / `planet-all` |
| Structs on a planet | `structsd query structs struct-all-by-planet [planet-id]` |
| Struct detail | `structsd query structs struct [id]` |
| Guild | `structsd query structs guild [id]` / `guild-all` |
| Guild members | `structsd query structs guild-membership-all-by-guild [guild-id]` |
| Reactor | `structsd query structs reactor [id]` / `reactor-all` |
| Provider / market | `structsd query structs provider [id]` / `provider-all` |
| Fleet | `structsd query structs fleet [id]` |
| Substation / power | `structsd query structs substation [id]` |

**Requires** [`structsd`](https://structs.ai/skills/structsd-install/SKILL) on PATH (no key needed for queries).

## Verification

Intel is only as good as its freshness. Confirm a raid window by re-running `struct-all-by-planet` + the owner's Command Ship status immediately before acting, and compare the new block height to your stored `scoutedAtBlock`.

## Errors

- **Empty/old results** — the public RPC may lag; re-query or use a Guild Stack mirror for consistency.
- **Entity not found** — wrong ID format; use `--` before IDs and confirm with an `-all` query.
- **Stale read** — power/fleet changed since you scouted; re-scout before committing PoW.
