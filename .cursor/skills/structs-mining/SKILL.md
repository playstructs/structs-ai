# Structs Mining

## Procedure

1. **Check planet ore** — `structsd query structs planet [id]`. If `currentOre == 0`, explore new planet first.
2. **Initiate mine** — The mine action is implicit in `struct-ore-mine-compute`. Launch in a background terminal: `structsd tx structs struct-ore-mine-compute [struct-id] -D 8 --from [key-name] --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.5 -y`. Mining difficulty is 14,000; expect **~8 hours** for difficulty to drop to D=8. Compute auto-submits the complete transaction.
3. **Refine immediately after mine completes** — Ore is stealable. Launch refine in background: `structsd tx structs struct-ore-refine-compute [struct-id] -D 8 --from [key-name] --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.5 -y`. Refining difficulty is 28,000; expect **~15 hours** for D=8. Compute auto-submits the complete transaction.
4. **Store or convert** — Alpha Matter is not stealable. Use reactor (1g = 1 kW) or generator infusion as needed.
5. **Verify** — Query planet (ore decreased), struct (ore/Alpha state), player (resources).

**CRITICAL**: Mining and refining are **multi-hour background operations**. Launch compute in a background terminal and do other things while waiting. Never sit idle watching a hash grind. See `awareness/async-operations.md`.

**CRITICAL**: Ore is stealable. Alpha Matter is not. Refine as soon as mining completes — every hour ore sits unrefined is an hour it can be stolen.

## Commands Reference

| Action | CLI Command |
|--------|-------------|
| Mine compute (PoW + auto-complete) | `structsd tx structs struct-ore-mine-compute [struct-id] -D 5` |
| Mine complete (manual, rarely needed) | `structsd tx structs struct-ore-mine-complete [struct-id]` |
| Refine compute (PoW + auto-complete) | `structsd tx structs struct-ore-refine-compute [struct-id] -D 5` |
| Refine complete (manual, rarely needed) | `structsd tx structs struct-ore-refine-complete [struct-id]` |
| Query planet | `structsd query structs planet [id]` |
| Query struct | `structsd query structs struct [id]` |
| Query player | `structsd query structs player [id]` |

Common tx flags: `--from [key-name] --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.5 -y`.

## Verification

- Planet `currentOre` decreases after mine-complete
- Struct ore inventory clears after refine-complete
- Player Alpha Matter increases after refine-complete

## Error Handling

- **"struct offline"** — Activate struct before mining.
- **"insufficient ore"** — Planet depleted or struct has no ore; check planet `currentOre`.
- **"proof invalid"** — Re-run compute with correct difficulty; ensure no interruption.
- **Ore stolen** — Refine immediately after every mine. Never leave ore unrefined.

## Timing

Mining and refining have high base difficulties, meaning they take **hours** for difficulty to drop to a feasible level. At D=8, the hash itself completes in seconds — the wait IS the time.

| Operation | Difficulty | D=8 | D=5 |
|-----------|------------|------|------|
| Mine | 14,000 | ~8.1 hr | ~12.7 hr |
| Refine | 28,000 | ~15.0 hr | ~24.4 hr |
| Full cycle (mine + refine) | -- | ~23 hr | ~37 hr |

**Use `-D 8`** for mine/refine. The difference between D=8 and D=5 is several hours of additional waiting for negligible hash speed improvement.

**Pipeline strategy**: After initiating a mine, immediately do other things — build structs, scout players, plan defense. When the mine completes, immediately start the refine. While refining runs (~15 hr), you have time to initiate the next mine so its age clock starts ticking. Always keep something aging.
