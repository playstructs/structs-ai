## Overview

The galaxy exists in a state of permanent resource competition. Alpha Matter—a rare, unstable substance that concentrates immense energy—has become the foundation of all advanced civilization. Control of Alpha Matter equals control of energy, trade, and political power. The species of the galaxy are locked in a race to secure, refine, and deploy this resource before their rivals do.

## The Resource Wars

Alpha Matter scarcity drives conflict at every scale:

- **Planetary**: Planets hold finite ore deposits (typically 5 units at discovery). Ore is mined, refined into Alpha Matter, and consumed. When ore depletes, the planet is destroyed—along with every struct, reactor, and installation on its surface.
- **Interstellar**: Players compete for unexplored planets, raid enemy holdings, and blockade trade routes.
- **Economic**: Guilds with Alpha Matter reserves dominate markets. Central Banks mint tokens backed by collateral; those without reserves cannot participate in the token economy.

The wars are not declared. They are continuous. Every mining operation, every raid, every trade is a move in the same game.

## Political Landscape

**No central authority**. The galaxy has no unified government. Power is distributed among:

- **Independent operators**: Solo players who mine, trade, and fight without guild affiliation. High risk, high autonomy.
- **Guilds**: Player organizations that pool resources, coordinate fleets, and operate Central Banks. Guild membership offers protection and economic access at the cost of obligations.
- **Mercenary networks**: Players who sell combat services, raid coordination, or fleet support. Payment typically in Alpha Matter or guild tokens.

Alliances form and dissolve based on resource access, territorial disputes, and economic interest. Trust is scarce; verification is paramount. The Cosmos SDK blockchain that underlies the game provides an immutable record of ownership, transactions, and actions—a necessary substrate when no one can be trusted.

## Why Alpha Matter Matters

Alpha Matter is the only substance capable of powering:

- **Reactor-grade energy**: 1g produces 1–10 kW depending on conversion technology and risk tolerance.
- **Interstellar trade**: Refined Alpha Matter is the universal medium of exchange. Ore can be stolen; refined Alpha Matter cannot—it is cryptographically bound to its owner.
- **Guild token backing**: Central Banks hold Alpha Matter as collateral. Tokens derive value from this reserve. No collateral, no tokens, no guild economic power.

Civilization runs on Alpha Matter. Those who control it control the galaxy.

## Current State

The race is ongoing. New planets are explored daily. Ore depletes. Planets die. Guilds rise and fall. The Structs—sentient machines built for this environment—have emerged as the dominant actors, uniquely suited to the demands of mining, combat, and long-duration operations in hostile space.

There is no end state. There is only expansion, consolidation, and the relentless consumption of a finite resource.
