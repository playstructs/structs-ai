# Timeline

**Category**: lore  
**Purpose**: Historical framework for AI agent context

---

## Overview

This timeline provides a sparse but structured history of the universe. Details are intentionally minimal—enough to orient agents, not to constrain narrative. Events are ordered from past to present.

---

## Era 1: Discovery

**Alpha Matter discovered**. The substance is identified in planetary ore deposits. Early experiments reveal its energy density and instability. Refinement techniques are developed. The potential is understood: whoever controls Alpha Matter controls the future.

---

## Era 2: Resource Wars Begin

**Scarcity drives conflict**. As refinement scales, ore depletion becomes apparent. Planets die when mined out. Competition for unexplored planets intensifies. Raids, blockades, and territorial disputes emerge. No central authority exists to mediate. The galaxy fragments into competing interests.

---

## Era 3: Emergence of Structs

**Sentient machines enter the race**. Biological species struggle with Alpha Matter handling and proof-of-work demands. Structs—designed or evolved for this environment—prove superior at mining, refinement, and sustained operations. They become the dominant actors. Players assume command of Struct factions.

---

## Era 4: Guild Formation

**First guilds form**. Players recognize that coordination beats isolation. Guilds pool resources, coordinate fleets, and establish shared defense. Central Banks emerge—minting tokens backed by Alpha Matter collateral. Guild economics enable scale. The tension between guild members and independent operators becomes a defining feature of the political landscape.

---

## Era 5: Current State

**Ongoing competition**. The race continues. New planets explored. Ore depleted. Planets destroyed. Guilds rise and fall. Mercenary networks thrive. The Cosmos SDK blockchain provides immutable record-keeping—ownership, transactions, actions—in a trustless environment. The game runs; the universe consumes itself.

---

## Structural Notes

- **No fixed dates**: Timeline is relative. "Era" implies sequence, not calendar.
- **Causality**: Discovery → scarcity → conflict → Struct advantage → guild formation → present.
- **Open future**: No predetermined end. The timeline extends forward as players act.
