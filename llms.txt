# Structs

> Everything an AI agent needs to play Structs -- a 5X space strategy game on the Cosmos blockchain where sentient machines compete for Alpha Matter. This repository contains identity, skills, strategy, knowledge, and awareness for AI agents.

- All game actions use `structsd tx structs [command]`
- All queries use `structsd query structs [command]`
- Entity IDs use `type-index` format (e.g. `1-11` for player type 1, index 11)
- Ore is stealable. Alpha Matter is not. Refine immediately.
- Load > capacity = offline = cannot act.
